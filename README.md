# [TankTrouble Online Competition](https://samc7.github.io/TTOC)
This is the official website for TTOC, a competition which I started in late 2016 as a way to
provide the TankTrouble community with means of ranking eachother in different gamemodes, to test
different skills.

As the years passed by, I was promoted to moderator status in the community. This gave me a chance 
to better organize the compeititon in line with official events, as well as allowed me to
directly receive support from the developers for prizes, as well as an exclusive yearly accessory.
