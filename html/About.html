                        Started in 2016, TTOC was originally an idea just to bring players together for more organized
                        destruction on TankTrouble. As the ideas turned into dreams, the Crew turned the dreams into 
                        reality, and made the largest competition TankTrouble has to offer to date. Here is the entire
                        TTOC Crew, as well as our history.

                        TTOC would be nothing without the dedicated players who came together
                        to help organize such a large event. Thanks to these players' ideas, the 
                        competition has been more and more exciting each year, adding more to its
                        already exciting selection of gamemodes and prizes. Here are all the crew members,
                        past and present, who have contributed to TTOC over the years.

                        2016 - How it all started
                    </h2>

                    <p class="justify">
                        TTOC begin back in 2016, when Sam wanted to step up his competition-hosting game. 
                        He came up with an idea to host an Olympics-styled tournament to host for all
                        TankTrouble players, once TankTrouble Online Beta would be released. He began
                        asking other acting TankTrouble members for help, such as Dalek-Buster and Zexel.
                        Looking for a suitable name, Dalek-Buster came up with the TankTrouble Olympics
                        (TTO). Sam and Zexel then began creating and organizing what would be the most 
                        popular TankTrouble event in years to come. With the help of captainahvong and 
                        Trabantt, the gamemode-testing phase began, initiating classic 1v1s, as well as 
                        new modes testing other skills such as Laser, Golf and Target. Later on, TTO was
                        renamed to TankTrouble Online Battles (TTOB), as the term "Olympics"
                        was copyrighted. The last addition to the crew this year was george8888, who was
                        the only non-Beta tester member, who had simplified and organized the TTOC documents
                        which presented all the competition information. The first TTOB competition took place
                        in November, two months after TankTrouble Online Beta was released to the public.
                        The competition only sustained popularity until the end of the Classic gamemode, 
                        in which Dalek-Buster took the victory, as we did not receive enough entries to 
                        continue with the rest of the gamemodes. At the end of the year, it was clear
                        that the Crew needed to reduce the amount of documents involved in the competition.

                        2017 - Officially Sponsored Prizes
                    </h2>

                    <p class="justify">
                        The year started off with a bizzare suggestion from george8888 — prizes to the 
                        winners of each gamemode. Originally, the idea was thought to be impossible, 
                        especially to Sam, however after a single email sent to the TankTrouble developers,
                        george8888 landed TTOB prizes for the top three players in each gamemode.
                        Now that TankTrouble Online Beta was free, the start date for the next TTOB was set
                        for June of 2017, and would repeat yearly. At the start of the competition, TTOB was 
                        renamed to the TankTrouble Online Competition, as it had become nearly official with
                        the sponsored prizes. A news post was also produced by the
                        developers, who wanted an even bigger competition this year!

                        During the normal competition, the Laser gamemode was completed
                        after classic, with captainahvong sniping their way to victory, and Sam winning Classic.
                        In honour of the 10th anniversary of TankTrouble, a community voted gamemode — Candy 
                        Tanks by mud — was hosted by TTOC. Since private matches had not been implemented,
                        the Laser and Candy Tanks gamemode were fairly lengthy, but completed nevertheless.
                        As usual, the TTOC Documents were further simplified, and were made easier for players to
                        understand, but there were still too many to keep up with.

                            The year started off as usual with crazy ideas, such as a competition-exclusive
                            accessory. The Crew recruited Giraffe and meemee to prototype the design,
                            which in the end was approved by the developers to be a TTOC banner with the 
                            year, as well as stars showering down. It was a chaotic but rewarding year for TTOC, 
                            as 9thDr aided in organizing and running 
                            the matches for a week while Sam went on vacation. All four TTOC gamemodes were completed, 
                            including Target and Golf, allowing the competition cling onto the theme of a competition 
                            testing various skills in TankTrouble.

                    <p class="justify">
                        The competition had started off well, with 32 players in the Classic gamemode, which
                        meant organizing over 64 matches in Classic. Unfortunately, due to unexpected circumstances
                        of the competition extending past summer break, the competition was ended midway through
                        the Weapons gamemode. This lead to much disappointment from the participants, but it was 
                        astonishing enough that the Classic gamemode was complete at all.
                        The weapons gamemode was cancelled during the semifinals, which left players still in the 
                        competition unsatisfied. The plan for 2020, was clear: Tighter time management for 
                        players in each gamemode, as well as better spectator management.

                        created a new Gold Rush gamemode, a simpler competition sytem, and also created a

                    <p class="justify">
                        The season started off wobbly, but it was able to finish. The plan was to automate the TTOC process as much as possible, including matchmaking. 
                        This did not go so well. On top of that, the season was only officially started midway through August, which was roughly three months later 
                        than the originally planned date. There was only enough time for two gamemodes to prevent clashing with Clans' schedule. Decided by the community, 
                        the Weapons Gamemode won the vote of the second gamemode. Unexpectedly, the site encountered multiple certificate expirations that rendered 
                        TankTrouble unplayable for weeks, which also affected the third place Weapons match, pushing it back by a month. 
                        The plan for next year is clear: starting TTOC on-time and having a better season plan.
