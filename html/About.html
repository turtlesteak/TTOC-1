                        Started in 2016, TTOC was originally an idea just to bring players together for more organized
                        destruction on TankTrouble. As the ideas turned into dreams, the Crew turned the dreams into 
                        reality, and made the largest competition TankTrouble has to offer to date. Here is the entire
                        TTOC Crew, as well as our history.

                        to help organize such a large event. Thanks to these players' ideas, the 
                        competition has been more and more exciting each year, adding more to its
                        already exciting selection of gamemodes and prizes. Here are all the crew members,

                        2016 - How it all started
                    </h2>

                    <p class="justify">
                        TTOC begin back in 2016, when 5am wanted to step up his competition-hosting game. 
                        He came up with an idea to host an Olympics-styled tournament to host for all
                        TankTrouble players, once TankTrouble Online Beta would be released. He began
                        asking other acting TankTrouble memers for help, such as Dalek-Buster and Zexel.
                        Looking for a suitable name, Dalek-Buster came up with the TankTrouble Olympics
                        (TTO). 5am and Zexel then began creating and organizing what would be the most 
                        popular TankTrouble event in years to come. With the help of captainahvong and 
                        Trabantt, the gamemode-testing phase began, initiating classic 1v1s, as well as 
                        new modes testing other skills such as Laser, Golf and Target. Later on, TTO was
                        renamed to TankTrouble Online Battles (TTOB), as the term "Olympics"
                        was copyrighted. The last addition to the crew this year was george8888, who was
                        the only non-Beta tester member, who had simplified and organized the TTOC documents
                        which presented all the competition information. The first TTOB compeition took place
                        in November, two months after TankTrouble Online Beta was released to the public.
                        The competition only sustained popularity until the end of the Classic gamemode, 
                        in which Dalek-Buster took the victory, as we did not receive enough entries to 
                        continue with the rest of the gamemodes. At the end of the year, it was clear
                        that the Crew needed to reduce the amount of documents involved in the competition.

                        2017 - Officially Sponsored Prizes
                    </h2>

                    <p class="justify">
                        The year started off with a bizzare suggestion from george8888 -- prizes to the 
                        winners of each gamemode. Originally, the idea was thought to be impossible, 
                        especially to 5am, however after a single email sent to the TankTrouble developers,
                        george8888 had gotten TTOB prizes for the top three players in each gamemode.
                        Now that TankTrouble Online Beta was free, the start date for the next TTOB was set
                        for June of 2017, and would repeat yearly. At the start of the competition, TTOB was 
                        renamed to the TankTrouble Online Competition, as it had become nearly official with
                        the sponsored prizes. A news post was also produced by the
                        developers, who wanted an even bigger competition this year!

                        During the normal competition, the Laser gamemode was completed
                        after classic, with captainahvong sniping their way to victory, and 5am winning Classic.
                        In honour of the 10th anniversary of TankTrouble, a community voted gamemode -- Candy 
                        Tanks by mud -- was hosted by TTOC. Since private matches hadn't been implemented,
                        the Laser and Candy Tanks gamemode were fairly lengthy, but were completed nevertheless,
                        with Rediey taking the sugary win, aided by a handful of multi-coloured guests.
                        As usual, the TTOC Documents were further simplified, and were made easier for players to
                        understand, but there were far too many to keep up with.

                            The year started off as usual with crazy ideas, such as a competition-exclusive
                            accessory. The Crew recruited Giraffe and meemee to prototype the design,
                            which in the end was approved by the developers to be a TTOC banner with the 
                            year, as well as stars showering down. It was a chaotic but rewarding year for TTOC, 
                            as 9thDr aided in organizing and running 
                            the matches for a week while 5am went on vacation. All four TTOC gamemodes were completed, 
                            including Target and Golf, refilling the gap to cling onto the theme of Olympics – a competition 
                            testing various skills in TankTrouble.

                        The competition had started off well, with 32 players in the Classic gamemode, which
                        meant organizing over 64 matches in Classic. Unfortunately, due to unexpected circumstances
                        of the competition extending past summer break. The early cancellation of the three other 
                        official gamemodes lead to much disappointment from the participants, but it was 
                        astonishing enough that the Classic gamemode was complete at all.
                        The weapons gamemode was cancelled during the semifinals, which left players still in the 
                        competition unsatisfied. The plan for 2020, was clear: Tighter time management for 
                        players in each gamemode, as well as better spectator management.
