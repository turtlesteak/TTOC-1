                            Referees will keep score in chat during matches (excluding Gold Rush), and will keep 2 tanks signed in to prevent public spectators from entering and interfering with the match. 
                            Do not leave the match unless the Referee grants you permission to do so.

                            You may only change the server if "no matching servers" or "split server allowed" is listed alongside the server name.
                            To change the match server, both Players must agree and notify the Referee(s) during the meetup. These new servers must be fair in server ms.

                            If a gamemode rule is broken during the match, the Player will receive a strike. After three strikes, each infraction will result in a point for the opponent.
                            If an infraction is severe enough, the round ends immediately, the opponent will get a point (instead of a strike), and the match continues next round (unless they win).
