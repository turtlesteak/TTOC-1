                            Referees will keep score in chat during matches (excluding Gold Rush), and will keep 2 tanks signed in to prevent public spectators from entering and interfering with the match. 
                            Do not leave the match unless the Referee grants you permission to do so.

                            Players and Referees are required to show up to their match if they did not confirm nor cancel their match. If they do not show, they will be removed and will no longer be allowed to participate in the current TTOC season.

                            The server listed for each match is the server for the entire match. This is also called the meetup server.

                                    Players may only change the server if "no matching servers" or "split server allowed" is listed alongside the server name.
                                    To change the match server, both Players must agree and notify the Referee(s) during the meetup. These new servers must be fair in server ms.

                                    Alternatively, Players may opt for a "double set" match. The match is played twice, once in each of the Players' best servers.
                                    <br>Note the total duration of such a match is <i>at least</i> double the expected match time, which varies in gamemodes and player skill.
                                    <br>Please be aware of your availability limitations.
                                    <br>For this option, Players must notify the Crew and be approved.

                            If a gamemode rule is broken during the match, the Player will receive a strike. After three strikes, each infraction will result in a point for the opponent.
                            If an infraction is severe enough, the round ends immediately, the opponent will get a point (instead of a strike), and the match continues next round (unless they win).
